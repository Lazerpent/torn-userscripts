This is a collection of userscripts that I wrote for Torn (https://www.torn.com, an online RPG game).

In order to use the scripts, you need to have tampermonkey installed. It's available as extension for Firefox (including the Android version), Opera, Safari, and Chrome web browsers, among others. Go to https://www.tampermonkey.net or use your browser's own extension store to install it.

Once you have tampermonkey installed, open the script you want to use and click "Raw" button. Then follow the prompt to install the script. That's it, enjoy!
